# **House Price Prediction**
This repository contains a machine learning project to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, and the number of bathrooms. The model was built using Python, pandas for data manipulation, and machine learning techniques to train and test the prediction model.

# **Project Overview**
The objective of this project is to develop a model that predicts house prices based on the available features in the dataset. The following steps were followed to complete this project:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing.
* Exploratory data analysis
* Model training using various machine learning algorithms
* Model evaluation and tuning
  
# **Features**
The dataset includes the following features:

* Location: The area where the house is located
* Size: The number of bedrooms
* Total_sqft: The total square footage of the house
* Bath: The number of bathrooms
* Price: The target variable, representing the price of the house in lakhs (or a similar currency unit)
  
# **Libraries Used**
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn
  
# **Project Structure**
HousePricePrediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

# **Model Performance**
Various models such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests were evaluated. The performance metrics (like R-squared and MAE) are discussed in the notebook.

# **Credits**
This project is inspired by and uses content from Dhaval Patel (Codebasics). Special thanks to him for providing valuable resources and guidance for building this model.
